# Janstun Toolbox [![Build Status][bdg-build-status]][action-tests]

A bunch of converters, data structures, parsers, validators, middlewares and injectors useful when crafting software in
Golang specially in early stages. They're designed with **Open-closed principle** in mind; In other words they are open
for extension and customization by others from outside. Most of them introduce and work with interfaces or data types
which are implemented for specific use-cases while can become implemented and extended in external packages.

This repository is a monorepo which consists of some (go) modules, each providing related functionalities:

## [Bricks][mod-bricks] [![Coverage Badge][bdg-cov-bricks]][action-tests]
Models of real world basic entities like phone number and iban.

## [Tricks][mod-tricks] [![Coverage Badge][bdg-cov-tricks]][action-tests]
Frequent low-level functionalities like conversions or functional paradigm missing utilities.

## [Handywares][mod-handywares] [![Coverage Badge][bdg-cov-handywares]][action-tests]
Mid-level requirements designed in a reusable manner like general http middlewares.

## [Kareless][mod-kareless] [![Coverage Badge][bdg-cov-kareless]][action-tests]
Thin dependency injector which tries not to be a dependency injector at all.
