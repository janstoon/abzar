# Toolbox
A bunch of converters, data structures, parsers, validators, middlewares and injectors useful when crafting software in
Golang. They're designed with **Open-closed principle** in mind; In other words they are open for extension and
customization by others from outside. Most of them introduce and work with interfaces or data types which are
implemented for specific use-cases while can become implemented and extended in external packages.
